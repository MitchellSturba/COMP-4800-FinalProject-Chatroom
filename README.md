# COMP-4800-FinalProject-Chatroom
A simple chatroom using Django (which implements distributed systems) and WebSocket as well as other tools. 

Run the webserver from the same directory level that contains the manage.py (essentially the root directory of the project/app, named chatapp in this case).
