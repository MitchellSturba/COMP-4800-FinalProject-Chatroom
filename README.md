# COMP-4800-FinalProject-Chatroom
A simple chatroom using the Socket module found in Python that creates an easy to use P2P (peer-to-peer) chat room located in the terminal window.

To run this chat program, first have a separate terminal/console window and run `python server.py` .
Choose a port number for your server host.
Create a new window and run `python client.py` .
Enter the host's ip and port number, then enter your username for the session.
On the empty new-line, start typing and you should see these messages appear in both the sever and client windows.
